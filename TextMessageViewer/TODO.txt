Update process of reading Nokia message (*.vmg) files - try formatting to "vmsg" format (has embedded vcf)
	 - can't do this without updating messages written (not imported) to use embedded vcard format

Add names of contacts in a different column
	- think more about how to display 
		- single column for contact, or multiple contact columns for From and To contacts
		- have done single column and didn't like as when sorting messages from same contact but different numbers (also +44 vs 0...) don't appear next to one another

Think about changing TextMessage from having a string number field to List<string> numbers to support multiple recipents
	- Number property would stay and return the first number in the list
	- Multiple constructors

Add support for multiple recipients and MMS (images)
Add support for other text message formats/phone manufacturers:
	Samsung - PC Studio Message Manager
	Sony Ericsson - Sony Ericsson PC Suite (*.SMS), [FJ Software MyPhoneExplorer]
	LG - ?
	Blackberry - ?
	Apple - ?
(Something for Mac OS: nova media's FoneLink software - support for multiple phones)
	
Document all code!!

When editing, think about editing exiting listviewitem and/or message

Improve cache to be keyed by Phone/MessageFolder
Or at least to contain a list of ListViewItems - currently better to store in an array 
as many calls insert the value into the listview.
Limited benefits when adding or editing message - to easily add to cache collection.
	
Implement the following:
	searching - within text, from/to someone, within dates
